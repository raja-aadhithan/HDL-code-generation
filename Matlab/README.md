In the matlab vs simulink output waveform, yellow legend used for reference would not be visible, indicating that the actual and reference signal overlaps.

the key is to check the red line representing error which stands at zero.

In the Tx vs Rx signal the generated Tx signal is random and one such example is placed at this image.Running the .m code would generate a peak at different Tx location.
