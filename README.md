# HDL Coder project

Final year project - Raja Aadhithan / Department of Electronic Science / University of Delhi

Below are the steps necessary to implement a MATLAB algorithm in FPGA hardware which is done in this project, including:
* Create a streaming version of the algorithm using Simulink
* Implement the hardware architecture
* Convert the design to fixed-point
* Generate and synthesize the HDL code
