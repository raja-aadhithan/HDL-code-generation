# HDL Coder project
In this project we will do the steps necessary to implement a MATLAB algorithm in FPGA hardware, including:
* Create a streaming version of the algorithm using Simulink
* Implement the hardware architecture
* Convert the design to fixed-point
* Generate and synthesize the HDL code
